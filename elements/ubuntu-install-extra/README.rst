====================

This obsolete element, which is supported only for pEWC installs the scripts required to allow for Multiple NIC networking on the pilot
Those scripts are maintained currently on nexus.ecmwf.int but are not expected to be used on the CCI and are here only for 
completeness.

It also installs a few binaries requested by users.
