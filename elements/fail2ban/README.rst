fail2ban
========

This element installs the fail2ban additional binary from the upstream repositories.
In the case of rocky linux, fail2ban lives in epel so the 'epel' element must also be included.

In addition, a compulsory jail.local is expected, localy on the build system, to be inserted in the final image.
